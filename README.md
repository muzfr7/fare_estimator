# Fare Estimator
A fare estimator app which receives cab positions/paths for each ride in a csv file and returns a csv file with estimated fares for each ride. It uses `Haversine distance formula` to calculate distance between two (lat, lng) pairs.

## Constraints

Input `paths.csv` consist of:
```
id_ride, lat, lng, timestamp
```

Output `result.csv` will contain:
```
id_ride, fare_estimate
```

Discard invalid entries:
```
Filtering should be performed as follows: consecutive tuples p1, p2 should be used to calculate the segmentâ€™s speed U. If U > 100km/h, p2 should be removed from the set.
```

### Fare estimation

Amount when cab is moving at `> 10km/h` during day time `(05:00, 00:00)`
```
0.74 per km
```

Amount when cab is moving at `> 10km/h` during night time `(00:00, 05:00)`
```
1.30 per km
```

Amount when cab is idle `<= 10km/h` at anytime
```
11.90 per hour of idle time
```

Standard flag amount is charged to the rides fare
```
1.30, the minimum ride fare should be at least 3.47
```
